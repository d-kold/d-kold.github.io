Hi! I’m Devendra…Dev for short. 👋🏼

I use this space for ….hmm 🤔, well let’s call it my digital scratchpad that I want you to see. You can find posts on [topics](notes/now.md) that interest me; from podcasts to research papers to movies.

A little about me…

I am an Electrical Engineer. I work as a Data Platform Engineer at a B2B SaaS company where I work at the intersection of software and energy analytics. I enjoy indulging in the daily news drama with my morning coffee…well as a matter of fact any drama would do ;) Oh and I vehemently forage the interwebs for jokes and good music.

I like to read up on software, products and management. You can find my current reading list here.


You can reach out to me through my social media profiles or <a href = "mailto: kulkarnidevendra21@gmail.com">write to me</a>
 to discuss ideas, collaborate or to just ketchup.

Fin <br>Dev
